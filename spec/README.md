### UTM Adapter Specification

This document details at a high level the requirements for a UTM adapter that will be integrated in QGCS codebase, on the UTM Service provider side, the interfaces . The **Deliverables** detail specific outputs that will be developed as a part of this effort. 

## Background
UTM services or U-space services as it is called in the EU are a set of digital services to enable complex drone operations and eventually a exchange of data with manned aviation. U-space services are regulated in the EU and will be verified and certified by competent authorities. Automated verification of the ability to conform to UTM standards forms a part of the UTM Service provider (USSP) certification framework. 

The EU U-space law builds a regulatory framework for UTM, it is expected that other jurisdictions will have their own version of UTM regulations, while this work at this time (June 2023) uses language and services as described / used in the EU U-Space law, it is not limited to it. It is expected that the codebase will change as other jurisdictions will build a regulatory / legal framework for integrating drones in the airspace and enabling "advanced" operations like BVLOS etc. 

### UTM Standards 
The [EU U-Space law](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0664) and the associated [acceptable means of compliance (AMC) and guidance material (GM)](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/acceptable-means-of-compliance-and-guidance-materials/amc-and-gm-implementing) has been published. 
- [Network Remote ID](https://www.astm.org/f3411-22a.html): Mentioned in the AMC/GM document as a acceptable way to comply to Net-RID. This standard specifies interfaces to ensure that 
- [EuroCAE ED-269](https://eurocae.net/news/posts/2020/june/ed-269-minimum-operational-performance-standard-for-uas-geo-fencing/): Mentioned in the AMC/GM document as a acceptable way to share with Geozone information.
- [USSP Interoperability](https://www.astm.org/f3548-21.html): Sharing operational intents / flight authorization can be shared via this standard, the `interuss/dss` implements this standard. 
- [ED-270](https://www.eurocae.net/news/posts/2020/june/ed-270-minimum-operational-performance-specification-for-uas-geo-caging/) - MOPS for UAS geocaging
- [ED-282](https://www.eurocae.net/news/posts/2022/january/ed-282-minimum-operational-performance-standard-for-uas-e-reporting/) - MOPS for UAS E-Reporting of surveillance information generated by a UAS, i.e. either from the unmanned aircraft (UA) itself or its remote pilot station (RPS), at destination of other UAS and U-space services. 
- [Surveillance UTM Supplemental Data Service Provider (SDSP)](https://www.astm.org/workitem-wk69690) Specification for performance of supplemental data for UTM services. 

### Services with no / lack of standards
- Traffic information service: A service that shares crewed air-traffic information via an API, normally this is hosted by a Air-Navigation Service provider (ANSP) or the standards allow for a special types of "Supplemental Data Service Providers". For un-crewed traffic information the Network Remote ID standard provides for "Service Provider" and "Display Provider" mechanisms that can be used for displaying Net-RID information. 
- Common information service: A server that hosts and shares ED-269 Geozones and other information, currently there is no standard for it and this server will normally be expected to be hosted by an ANSP and / or an authority. 

## Core modules

### Configuration module
A JSON based config file will need to be developed that allows the operator / entity / person using the GCS to configure details of the UTM Service provider they want to use. These must be configured via a simple user-interface (or text editor) initially . A REST based adapter that can submit data to USSP interfaces on the internet and use JWT Bearer tokens as a way to interact with the APIs.

__Out of scope__:
- At this moment only REST based APIs and JWTs as a way to authenticate is in scope, the main reason for this that is that these are mentioned in the UTM standards, we are aware of other ways to authenticate / authorize but these can be added later. 

__Deliverables__:
- JSON specification that contains the details of an USSP implementation that the QGCS user-interface can read. 
- QGCS module / code that reads the JSON and interacts with the user-interface

### HTTP / network module
The core behavior of the internals of the adapter will be using HTTP REST based services. A high performance HTTP module that makes requests and processes responses is needed to handle the interaction with the USSP (per the config file)

__Deliverables__:
- A REST based component that interacts with the USSP APIs

### Notifications
Interaction with USSP and USSP network is a synchronous process and there needs to be a notification mechanism that tells the operator "prominently" what is going on in the UTM system. There is no standard for providing notifications to the operators but since some of the notifications will be safety critical. We are cognizant that there might be a standard that will be developed and the notifications mechanism might need to be adapted to the standard. It is noted that in some cases, it might be further necessary that the operator explicitly acknowledges receipt of a notification. 

## Security Considerations 
The UTM standards specify a baseline security mechnism using "internet-grade" security protocols e.g. OAUTH Client Credentials to access UTM system, additional security layers such as message-signing etc. are considered "advanced" for UTM, although they are rapidly changing. 

## Services
For the scope of this project, we will focus on the following five services. In the future additional services might be added to the adapter. To get sense of all the services a UTM system might provide, please review [this infographic](https://www.gpsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/U-Space-SESAR-JC-UAV-EC-report.jpg).

## A. Interface for Flight Authorization
__Goal__: Allow the GCS to send a flight plan to the USSP and get an associated flight authorization of submission of that plan.

__Pre-requisites__: 
- A flight plan is built in the QGCS user-interface and it is valid 
- A network connection exists between QGCS and USSP
- Metadata e.g. Operator ID etc. exists that will be passed to the USSP system

__Reference__: 
- Example submission of a plan [as GeoJSON](https://github.com/openskies-sh/flight-blender/blob/master/api/flight-blender-1.0.0-resolved.yaml#L1402)
- Example states of an operation [Flight Blender](https://github.com/openskies-sh/flight-blender/blob/master/api/flight-blender-1.0.0-resolved.yaml#L1885)

__Deliverables__:
- User interface in the QGCS panels to submit flight plan and get the responses
- Ability to define and store flight authorization profiles: store information about operator, operator location and other metadata

## B. Interface for Network RID / Telemetry

__Goal__: Allow the GCS to send live telemetry (for a registered operation) to the USSP via this QGCS user-interface so that the USSP can process the data and share it with the UTM network. 
__Pre-requisites__: 

- A plan is built and shared to the USSP and authorized by the USSP (see Flight Authorization service below). 
- Telemetry data from the drone should be submitted via TCP / IP with REST interfaces to the USSP that can be configured. For the same of this project, we assume that telemetry data is being sent from the GCS therefore the UAS -> USSP connection is out of scope but can be added later. 
- Additional data e.g. operator location, drone serial number, operator registration number etc. 

__Deliverables__:
- Status indicators that telemetry is being submitted to the USSP (and the USSP is receiving it)
- Ability to take remedial action incase of telemetry being interrupted
- Ability to declare emergency situations by the UAS operator

__Reference__: 
- Automated test for [ASTM network RID](https://github.com/interuss/monitoring/blob/main/monitoring/uss_qualifier/suites/astm/netrid/f3411_22a.yaml) exists
- [Data format](https://github.com/uastech/standards/blob/dd4016b09fc8cb98f30c2a17b5a088fb2995ab54/remoteid/canonical.yaml#L1692) per ASTM Remote ID standard


## C. Interface for Geozones
__Goal__: To build a way for QGCS to read Geozone information and show the latest data in the QGCS user interface. 

__Pre-requisites__: 
- In the EU this type of data is to be shared via the ED-269 / ED-26XX standard and provided via a API that the USSPs can automatically download these files / data periodically. This is out of scope of this project.
- The data must be provided to the GCS via a API call and displayed on the user-interface.

__Deliverables__:
- Ability to show geo-zone information and its details on the QGCS user-interface
- Ability to explicitly acknowledge safety-critical geo-zones


## D. Interface for Traffic Information
TODO
## E. Interface for Conformance Monitoring
TODO

### Software Reference
There exists open-source and closed-source software in the context of UTM that allows compliance with the regulations. UTM Service providers are companies that will provide a way for operators, drone pilots to interact with the UTM eco-system and conduct advanced operations. Below is a in-complete list of software that is available to help companies conform to the standards, if you are interested in understanding UTM deeply, we recommend that you review these software. 
- [interuss/dss](https://github.com/interuss/dss): Open source software the enables standards-compliant Discovery of UTM services and synchronization of data. 
- [interuss/monitoring](https://github.com/interuss/monitoring): A UTM services verification suite developed to test compliance against UTM standards
- [openskies-sh/flight-blender](https://github.com/openskies-sh/flight-blender): A reference implementation that implements in the open-source standards compliant UTM services passes the `interuss/monitoring` suite. It is used in the context of inter-operability testing by developers and enables third-party verification of UTM software.
